# Encrypted-Messenger on LAN
* A basic implementation of encryption using asymmetric cryptography.
* Used FLASK and Python for Server side programming and JAVASCRIPT and HTML for Client side.

* Used same pair of (public key, private key) for all the clients just for demo purpose, we can further extend it by storing their 
  respective pair of keys in a database, may be by using MongoDB.
* Its messages will be shown to all the connected clients.
* On every new connection, server will send a message "user".

Currently, converting it to private chat using multi threading.
Thank You :)
